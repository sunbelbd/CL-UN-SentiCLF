# Cross-Lingual Unsupervised Sentiment Classification with Multi-View Transfer Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains code that supports experiments in our ACL 2020 paper "Cross-Lingual Unsupervised Sentiment Classification with Multi-View Transfer Learning". Note that this is the PaddlePaddle version of the implementation, which is largely motivated and modified on unsupervised machine translation from the XLM codebase by Facebook AI Research. Great appreications to them! 

There is also a Pytorch version, which is available upon request.
